# Dataset-indoor-OPVs
1. This dataset includes 128 subsets of data, derived from various combinations of 31 donor materials and 32 acceptor materials.
2. The jupyterlab book shows the codes for building machine learning (ML) models using the dataset. The ML models include support vector regression (SVR), random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and artificial neural networks. The models can be further used to predict the power conversion efficiencies of six "unseen" donor/acceptor combinations for indoor organic photovoltaic devices.
